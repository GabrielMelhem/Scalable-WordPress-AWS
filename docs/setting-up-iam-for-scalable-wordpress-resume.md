# Setting Up IAM for Scalable WordPress Resume on AWS

## 1. Set Up AWS Account
Created an AWS Personal Free Tier account to implement a scalable WordPress online resume application.

## 2. Create IAM User for Administration
- Created an IAM user and assigned it to an Administrator group with the `AdministratorAccess` policy.
- Enabled **Billing Access** for the user.
- Set up **AWS Budget Limits** to avoid exceeding the free tier.

## 3. Creating IAM Groups for Role-Based Access
Created the following IAM groups with appropriate policies:
- **VPC-Admins**: Full access to manage VPC, subnets, and related resources (policy: `AmazonVPCFullAccess`).
- **Storage-Admins**: Full access to manage S3 buckets, CloudFront, and other storage services (policies: `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `CloudFrontFullAccess`).
- **Monitoring-Admins**: Full access to CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and other monitoring services (policies: `CloudWatchFullAccess`, `CloudTrail_FullAccess`).

## 4. Create IAM Users and Assign Them to Groups
Created the following IAM users:
- `VPCAdminUser`: Assigned to the `VPC-Admins` group.
- `StorageAdminUser`: Assigned to the `Storage-Admins` group.
- `MonitoringAdminUser`: Assigned to the `Monitoring-Admins` group.

## 5. Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Extra Security
Enabled **MFA**  for all IAM users (`VPCAdminUser`, `StorageAdminUser`, `MonitoringAdminUser`).


## 6. Testing Access
- Tested login and permissions for each user to ensure proper access to resources based on group membership.
- Verified MFA functionality for each user.
